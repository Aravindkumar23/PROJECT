        <p>We are one of India's biggest NGOs. Established in 1919, and present in more than 80 countries, we are one of the most influential, organised, well- networked, resourceful and impactful NGOs.

          Our core is our programmes, whether it is the remotest corners of the country or the most disaster-torn or dangerous areas or slums in metros, we do whatever it takes to help children shine in life.
          
          Save the Children works for providing equality, equal education, equal nutrition, equal health, equal opportunities, gender equality, and life-saving humanitarian situations and relief during natural disasters to the most deprived children of India.
          
          Our work in the areas of Child Education, Health & Nutrition, Child Protection and Humanitarian Response & Disaster Risk Reduction has benefitted lakhs of children in India. Last year alone we reached 22.75 lakh children through our programmes.
          
          We are at the forefront of protecting children whenever disasters strike. Our work involves creating inclusive learning environments in schools so that the most marginalised children can reach school and get quality education. Going by the philosophy of "No Child Born to Die", we work to end rampant deaths of children under 5 years of age in India. Another part of our work revolves around providing protection to children vulnerable to different social and physical threats. In all this, we ensure that we put children first in everything we do and champion their rights all along.
          
          Save the Children's s association with India is more than 80 years old when our founder Eglantyne Jebb drafted the 'Declaration of the Rights of the Child' in 1922 which was signed by Mahatma Gandhi in 1931. It was Jebb's vision which was eventually formalised as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) in 1989.</p>
